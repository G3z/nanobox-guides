# Add a Database

## Configure
You can add a database to your app by simply adding a data component to your `boxfile.yml`:

<div class="meta expand" data-method="snippet" data-params="data.db" ></div>

```yaml
run.config:
  engine: python

# add a postgres database
data.db:
  image: nanobox/postgresql
```

In the above snippet `db` is the `NAME` of this component, and can be anything you choose as long as it is unique.

Nanobox generates the following environment variables based off that name:

* `DATA_DB_HOST` : autogenerated unique host ip
* `DATA_DB_USER` : user to connect with
* `DATA_DB_PASS` : unique password

**HEADS UP**: Your database will be running the next time you `nanobox run`.

## Connect
Flask is pretty free-form when it comes to configuring a database connection. However you choose to configure your connection, you can access the following environment variables:

```python
import os

user    = os.environ.get('DATA_DB_USER')
passwd  = os.environ.get('DATA_DB_PASS')
host    = os.environ.get('DATA_DB_HOST')
```

#### Add dependency
If you are connecting to a third party service, you'll need a python extension to connect to the service. During the `build-runtime` phase, nanobox detects the development libraries your pip packages will need to properly install. The easiest way to install a dependency, is to add it to your `requirements.txt` and then running `nanobox build-runtime`, like this:

```bash
# add psycopg2 package to pip installation
echo "psycopg2==2.6.2" >> requirements.txt

# rebuild the runtime with the postgres client
nanobox build-runtime
```

## Test

#### Connect an external client
You can connect directly to your database from an <a href="https://docs.nanobox.io/local-dev/managing-local-data/" target="\_blank">external client</a>.

#### With Flask
Your can also test the connection by running your app:

```bash
nanobox run python myapp.py
```
