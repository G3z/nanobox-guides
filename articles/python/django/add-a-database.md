# Add a Database

## Configure
You can add a database to your app by simply adding a data component to your `boxfile.yml`:

<div class="meta" data-class="snippet" data-optional-components="postgres,mysql,mongo" ></div>

In the above snippet `db` is the `NAME` of this component, and can be anything you choose as long as it is unique.

Nanobox generates the following environment variables based off that name:

* `DATA_DB_HOST` : autogenerated unique host ip
* `DATA_DB_USER` : user to connect with
* `DATA_DB_PASS` : unique password

**HEADS UP**: Your database will be running the next time you `nanobox run`.

## Connect
Modify your `settings.py` to connect to your app:

```python
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2',
        'NAME': 'gonano',
        'USER': os.environ.get('DATA_DB_USER'),
        'PASSWORD': os.environ.get('DATA_DB_PASS'),
        'HOST': os.environ.get('DATA_DB_HOST'),
        'PORT': '',
    }
}
```

#### Add pip dependency
If you are connecting to a third party service, you'll need a python extension to connect to the service. During the `build-runtime` phase, nanobox detects the development libraries your pip packages will need to properly install. 

The easiest way to install a dependency, is to add it to your `requirements.txt` and then running `nanobox build-runtime`, like this:

```bash
# add psycopg2 package to pip installation
echo "psycopg2==2.6.2" >> requirements.txt

# rebuild the runtime with the postgres client
nanobox build-runtime
```

## Test

#### From an external client
You can connect directly to your database from an <a href="https://docs.nanobox.io/local-dev/managing-local-data/" target="\_blank">external client</a>.

#### From Django
You can also test your connection by simply trying to run your app and see if it is able to connect.

```bash
nanobox run python manage.py migrate
```
