# Add a Database

## Configure
You can add a database to your app by simply adding a data component to your `boxfile.yml`:

<div class="meta" data-class="snippet" data-optional-components="mysql,postgres" ></div>

In the above snippet `db` is the `NAME` of this component, and can be anything you choose as long as it is unique.

Nanobox generates the following environment variables based off that name:

* `DATA_DB_HOST` : autogenerated unique host ip
* `DATA_DB_USER` : user to connect with
* `DATA_DB_PASS` : unique password

**HEADS UP**: Your database will be provisioned the next time you `nanobox run`.

## Connect

However you choose to configure your connection within your PHP app, you can access the following environment variables:

```php
user = $_ENV["DATA_DB_USER"]
pass = $_ENV["DATA_DB_PASS"]
host = $_ENV["DATA_DB_HOST"]
```

#### Update dependencies
Regardless of what database you decide to use, you'll likely be adding some dependencies. Make sure once they are all added you update them in the environment as well.

## Test

#### From an external client
You can connect directly to your database from an <a href="https://docs.nanobox.io/data-management/managing-local-data/" target="\_blank">external client</a>.

#### From PHP
You can also test your connection by simply trying to run your app and see if it is able to connect.
