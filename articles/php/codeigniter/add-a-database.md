# Add a Database

## Configure
You can add a database to your app by simply adding a data component to your `boxfile.yml`:

<div class="meta" data-class="snippet" data-optional-components="mysql,postgres" ></div>

In the above snippet `db` is the `NAME` of this component, and can be anything you choose as long as it is unique.

Nanobox generates the following environment variables based off that name:

* `DATA_DB_HOST` : autogenerated unique host ip
* `DATA_DB_USER` : user to connect with
* `DATA_DB_PASS` : unique password

**HEADS UP**: Your database will be provisioned the next time you `nanobox run`.

## Connect

#### Include the DB Driver Extension
Add the required extension to the list of extensions in your `boxfile.yml`.

```yaml
run.config:
  engine.config:
    extensions:
      - mysqli
```

#### Modify Your database.php
Modify your `application/config/database.php` to connect your app:

**Port:** The port will always be the default port of the service you're using.  
**Name:** The database name will always be `gonano`.

```php
$db['default'] = array(
  'dsn'   => '',
  'hostname' => $_ENV["DATA_DB_HOST"],
  'username' => $_ENV["DATA_DB_USER"],
  'password' => $_ENV["DATA_DB_PASS"],
  'database' => 'gonano',
  'dbdriver' => 'mysqli',
  'dbprefix' => '',
  'pconnect' => TRUE,
  'db_debug' => TRUE,
  'cache_on' => FALSE,
  'cachedir' => '',
  'char_set' => 'utf8',
  'dbcollat' => 'utf8_general_ci',
  'swap_pre' => '',
  'encrypt' => FALSE,
  'compress' => FALSE,
  'stricton' => FALSE,
  'failover' => array()
);
```
**HEADS UP**: Any database created by nanobox will *always* be named `gonano`

## Test

#### From an external client
You can connect directly to your database from an <a href="https://docs.nanobox.io/local-dev/managing-local-data/" target="\_blank">external client</a>.

#### From Codeigniter
You can also test your connection by simply trying to run your app and see if it is able to connect.

Assuming you have migrations setup according to the [official guide](https://codeigniter.com/user_guide/libraries/migration.html), you can run them directly.

```bash
nanobox run php index.php migrate
```
