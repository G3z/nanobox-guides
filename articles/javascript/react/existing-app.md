# Existing React App
Part of what makes Nanobox so useful is you don't even need Nodejs or React installed on your local machine to use them.

## Setup

#### cd Into Your React App
Change into an existing project folder:

```bash
cd my-react-app
```

**HEADS UP**: All `nanobox` commands *must* be run from within your project folder.

#### Add a boxfile.yml
Nanobox uses a <a href="https://docs.nanobox.io/boxfile/" target="\_blank">boxfile.yml</a> to configure your app's environment.

At the root of your project create a `boxfile.yml` telling Nanobox you want to use the Nodejs <a href="https://docs.nanobox.io/engines/" target="\_blank">engine</a> and enable file watching:

```yaml
run.config:
  engine: nodejs
  fs_watch: true
```

## Add local DNS
Add a convenient way to access your app from the browser:

```bash
nanobox dns add local react.dev
```

## Set the Dev Host to 0.0.0.0
To allow connections from the host machine into the appâ€™s container, add a `HOST` environment variable that defines the host on which React listens while developing locally:

```bash
nanobox evar add local HOST=0.0.0.0
```

## Run the app
Start the app with React's "start" script:

```bash
nanobox run yarn start
```

Visit your app at <a href="http://react.dev" target="\_blank">react.dev</a>

## Explore
With Nanobox, you have everything you need develop and run your react app:

```bash
# drop into a Nanobox console
nanobox run

# where nodejs is installed,
node -v

# npm is installed,
npm -v

# and your code is mounted
ls

# exit the console
exit
```
