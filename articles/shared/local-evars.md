# Local Environment Variables

Environment variables allow your app to run in multiple environments without modifying the code. They're also handy for keeping sensitive information out of your codebase.

### Add
```bash
nanobox evar add local KEY1=VALUE1,KEY2=VALUE2
```

### Remove
```bash
nanobox evar rm local KEY1
```

### List
```bash
nanobox evar ls local
```
