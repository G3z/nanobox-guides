# App Health

To provide visibility into the health of your app, Nanobox provides RAM, CPU, Swap, and Disk stats in your app dashboard for your app and each of its components. Hourly summaries, trends, and breakdowns help to assess both the health of your app as well as possible bottlenecks or memory leaks.

## Summary View
An hourly summary for each multi-component server ([bunkhouse server](https://docs.nanobox.io/scaling/bunkhouse/)), app component, and platform component is available.
