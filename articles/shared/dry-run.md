# Dry run

Nanobox allows you to test your app in a production environment, locally, before you actually launch it into production with `dry-run`.

```bash
nanobox deploy dry-run
```

With `dry-run` your app will continue to run until stopped (`ctrl+c`). This allows you to to preview it, watch logs, seed data, and troubleshoot.
