# Dry run

Deploying live is scary. Nanobox allows you to test your app locally in a production environment before you actually launch into production.

## Deploy dry-run

```bash
nanobox deploy dry-run
```

The app will continue running until you explicitly ctrl-c to stop the app. During which time you will be able to preview the app, watch logs, seed data, and troubleshoot extensively.
