# Add a Database

## Configure
You can add a database to your app by simply adding a data component to your `boxfile.yml`:

<div class="meta" data-class="snippet" data-optional-components="postgres,mysql,mongo" ></div>

In the above snippet `db` is the `NAME` of this component, and can be anything you choose as long as it is unique.

Nanobox generates the following environment variables based off that name:

* `DATA_DB_HOST` : autogenerated unique host ip
* `DATA_DB_USER` : user to connect with
* `DATA_DB_PASS` : unique password

**HEADS UP**: Your database will be running the next time you `nanobox run`.

## Connect
Before connecting to the database you'll need to create a few files.

At the root of your project, create a `Rakefile` and a `config` folder with a `database.yml` and `environment.rb` inside.

The `Rakefile` should look like this:

<div class="meta" data-method="configFile" data-params="Rakefile"></div>

```rake
require 'sinatra/activerecord'
require 'sinatra/activerecord/rake'
require './myapp'
```

The `config/database.yml` file should look like this:

<div class="meta" data-method="configFile" data-params="config/database.yml"></div>

```yaml
development:
  adapter: postgresql
  encoding: unicode
  database: development
  host: <%= ENV['DATA_DB_HOST'] %>
  username: <%= ENV['DATA_DB_USER'] %>
  password: <%= ENV['DATA_DB_PASS'] %>
```

The `config/environment.rb` file should look like this:

<div class="meta" data-method="configFile" data-params="config/environment.rb"></div>

```ruby
#The environment variable DATABASE_URL should be in the following format:
# => postgres://{user}:{password}@{host}:{port}/path
configure :production, :development do
	db = URI.parse(ENV['DATABASE_URL'] || 'postgres://<component-ip>/db')

	ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection(
		:adapter  => db.scheme == 'postgres' ? 'postgresql' : db.scheme,
		:host     => db.host,
		:username => db.user,
		:password => db.password,
		:database => db.path[1..-1],
		:encoding => 'utf8'
	)
end
```

#### Update dependencies
There are a few more dependencies our app has how that we're connecting a database. Update the `Gemfile` with the following gems and run `bundle install`:

```ruby
gem "activerecord"
gem "sinatra-activerecord"
gem "pg"
```

## Test

#### From an external client
You can connect directly to your database from an <a href="https://docs.nanobox.io/local-dev/managing-local-data/" target="\_blank">external client</a>.

#### With sinatra
Your can also test the connection with sinatra:

```bash
nanobox run ruby myapp.rb
```
