# Add a Database

## Configure
You can add a database to your app by simply adding a data component to your `boxfile.yml`:

<div class="meta" data-class="snippet" data-optional-components="postgres,mysql,mongo" ></div>

In the above snippet `db` is the `NAME` of the component, and can be anything you choose as long as it's unique.

Nanobox generates the following environment variables based off that name:

* `DATA_DB_HOST` : autogenerated unique host ip
* `DATA_DB_USER` : user to connect with
* `DATA_DB_PASS` : unique password

**HEADS UP**: The next time you `nanobox run` your database will be provisioned.

## Connect
Sinatra is pretty free-form when it comes to configuring a database connection. This example will show you a basic configuration for postgres.

Create a `Rakefile`, `config/database.yml`, and `config/environments.rb`.

The `Rakefile` should look something like this:

<div class="meta" data-class="configFile" data-run="Rakefile"></div>

```rake
require 'sinatra/activerecord'
require 'sinatra/activerecord/rake'
require './app'
```

The `config/database.yml` should look something like this:

<div class="meta" data-class="configFile" data-run="config/database.yml"></div>

```yaml
default: &default
  adapter: postgresql
  encoding: unicode
  pool: 2
  host: <%= ENV['DATA_DB_HOST'] %>
  username: <%= ENV['DATA_DB_USER'] %>
  password: <%= ENV['DATA_DB_PASS'] %>

development:
  <<: *default
  database: development

production:
  <<: *default
  database: production
```

**HEADS UP**: Any database created by nanobox will *always* be named `gonano`

The `config/environments.rb` file should look something like this:

<div class="meta" data-class="configFile" data-run="config/environments.rb"></div>

```ruby
require 'sinatra/activerecord'

#The environment variable DATABASE_URL should be in the following format:
# => postgres://{user}:{password}@{host}:{port}/path
configure :production, :development do
  db = URI.parse(ENV['DATABASE_URL'] || "postgres://#{ENV['DATA_DB_USER']}:#{ENV['DATA_DB_PASS']}@#{ENV['DATA_DB_HOST']}/gonano")

  ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection(
    :adapter  => db.scheme == 'postgres' ? 'postgresql' : db.scheme,
    :host     => db.host,
    :username => db.user,
    :password => db.password,
    :database => db.path[1..-1],
    :encoding => 'utf8'
  )
end
```

Modify your app to include the `config/environments.rb` file:

```ruby
require './config/environments'
```

#### Update dependencies
Make sure your `Gemfile` has all the necessary dependencies for the database you're using. For postgres the following gems have been added:

```ruby
gem "activerecord"
gem "sinatra-activerecord"
gem "rake"
gem "pg"
```

Run `nanobox run bundle install` to install any new gems.

## Test

#### From an external client
You can connect directly to your database from an <a href="https://docs.nanobox.io/data-management/managing-local-data/" target="\_blank">external client</a>.

#### From Sinatra
Your can also test the connection with rake:

```bash
nanobox run bundle exec rake db:create
```

You'll see that your database has already been created and is ready to use!
