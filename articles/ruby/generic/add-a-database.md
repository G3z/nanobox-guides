# Add a Database

## Configure
You can add a database to your app by simply adding a data component to your `boxfile.yml`:

<div class="meta" data-class="snippet" data-optional-components="postgres,mysql,mongo" ></div>

In the above snippet `db` is the `NAME` of this component, and can be anything you choose as long as it is unique.

Nanobox generates the following environment variables based off that name:

* `DATA_DB_HOST` : autogenerated unique host ip
* `DATA_DB_USER` : user to connect with
* `DATA_DB_PASS` : unique password

**HEADS UP**: Your database will be running the next time you `nanobox run`.

## Connect
However you choose to configure your connection within your ruby app, you can access the following environment variables:

```ruby
user = ENV['DATA_DB_USER']
pass = ENV['DATA_DB_PASS']
host = ENV['DATA_DB_HOST']
```

#### Update dependencies
You may need to add some gems to interact with the database. Update the `Gemfile` with the following gems and run `bundle install`:

```bash
WIP
```

## Test

#### From an external client
You can connect directly to your database from an <a href="https://docs.nanobox.io/local-dev/managing-local-data/" target="\_blank">external client</a>.

#### With ruby
Your can also test the connection directly from your app:

```bash
nanobox run ruby YOURAPP.rb
```
