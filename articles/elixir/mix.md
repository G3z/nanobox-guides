# Mix

<!-- Mix is included in the [Elixir Engine](https://github.com/nanobox-io/nanobox-engine-ruby) making the `mix` executable available from your console. When building the runtime, the Elixir engine checks for a `requirements.txt` and, if found, runs `mix install -r requirements.txt` to install your python packages. -->

## Adding a package

<!-- ```bash
# Console into your dev container
nanobox dev console

# Run mix commands
mix install gunicorn

# add the newly installed dependency to the requirements.txt
mix freeze > requirements.txt
``` -->
