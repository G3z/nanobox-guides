# Add a Database

## Configure
You can add a database to your app by simply adding a data component to your `boxfile.yml`:

<div class="meta" data-class="snippet" data-optional-components="postgres,mysql,mongo" ></div>

In the above snippet `db` is the unique identifier of this component. It can be anything you choose as long as it is unique.

Nanobox generates the following environment variables based off that name:

* `DATA_DB_HOST` : autogenerated unique host ip
* `DATA_DB_USER` : user to connect with
* `DATA_DB_PASS` : unique password

For databases that require a name, the name will always be `gonano`.

**HEADS UP**: The next time you `nanobox run` your database will be provisioned.

## Connect
WIP

**HEADS UP**: Any database created by nanobox will *always* be named `gonano`

## Test

#### From an external client
You can connect directly to your database from an <a href="https://docs.nanobox.io/data-management/managing-local-data/" target="\_blank">external client</a>.

#### From Koa
Your can also test the connection with koa:

```bash
nanobox run node app.js
```
